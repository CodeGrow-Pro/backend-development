Cache Eviction Policies
1. the one that came in first, will be the first (FIFO)
2. the ones with higher priority - priority based eviction.
3. size based eviction policy - based on the size of the data
4. Least recently used - will be evicted first - LRU
5. Least Frequently used - the one with the least frequency of use is evicted first
    if there multiple keys in contention, 
        the one which was least recently used will be deleted first
